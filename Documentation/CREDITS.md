# Additional assets not included in repository

While Ascension III makes use of many external third-party assets, the base library and demo/example project no longer require these.

Most dependencies are included. A few of them are pulled in automatically as Unity packages:

- Post-Processing Stack (https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.postprocessing@2.1/manual/index.html)
- ProBuilder (https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.probuilder@3.0/manual/index.html)

A basic command console is included; the third party DevConsole 2 asset is no longer required. You can still use it if you want by installing the SickDevConsoleIntegration module and importing the DevConsole 2 asset from the Asset Store.

You can get the extra CommonCore modules at https://github.com/XCVG/commoncore-modules

There is no dependency on the Standard Assets but you can bring them in if you need to.
