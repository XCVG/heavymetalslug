Music is converted from MIDIs with foobar2000 and the MIDI player plugin (comes with foobar2000?)

Use Nuclear Option (Nuked OPL) output with 44100hz sampling rate. Preset OPL3W, no soft panning.

Don't loop or add 1s decay time.

These aren't the best settings, just the ones I used. I didn't really have time to experiment more :(

Use right-click->convert. I made a custom preset with output format: MP3 (LAME), 320kbps CBR and no processing. It doesn't really matter and in fact I transcoded later so pick whatever. Just no effects if you want to remain consistent.
