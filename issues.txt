POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS

Better camera control- no "snap" when control is returned, allow restricting the player to going forward but not backward

Implement player switching. You'll need to finish the sprites, too.

Actual 2P mode

Make player and a few other things prefabs

For some reason, the camera moves in when the helicopter fight starts. I couldn't be bothered to debug this

A high score system. One day I'll build a generalized one

If you want to make the main menu accessible, you should make it presentable

Pool the bullets

Character selection doesn't do anything except change the music. Th

Two-player isn't implemented.
