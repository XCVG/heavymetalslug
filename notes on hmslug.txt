HEAVY METAL SLUG source release
initial release, 2020-04-10

Built with Unity 2018.4.20f1. A newer version of Unity 2018 LTS will probably work fine.

You'll probably get a compile error because of the DevConsole 2 third-party dependency. To solve this, either download DevConsole from the Asset Store and put it in Assets/Plugins/DevConsole or delete Assets/CommonCoreModules/SickDevConsoleIntegration. It will probably warn if you do the latter but should fall back to the BasicConsole implementation.

The Unity Post-Processing V2 stack and ProBuilder should be pulled in from packages just fine.

The art folder contains a bunch of art assets, including some that aren't in the released game. These are licensed CC-BY 3.0 unless they're copied or derived from something else, but any that are should be obvious.

The source code is licensed under the MIT License. This includes everything in the source folder that isn't auto-generated and isn't a third party asset with its own license. Practically, this means CommonCore code, game-specific scripts, scene files and data assets.

If you need clarification or a formal statement on a certain file, contact me!

If you're going to reuse this, you must give credit (this is stipulated by CC-BY and the MIT license)! You must also not misrepresent your derivative work as the original, or yourself as me (also, I believe, stipulated by both licenses). You can credit me as Chris Leclair or XCVG. I'd also appreciate a link to my website, xcvgsystems.com, and let me know if you do something cool with it.

Finally, one last disclaimer: This package is provided without any warranty or any guarantee that it will be suitable for any purpose. Use at your own risk.
